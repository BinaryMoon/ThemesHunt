<!-- kw: WordPress Gaming Themes -->

If you’ve got an irrepressible urge to talk gaming - whether on console, or sat around the good ol’ tabletop - there are a wealth of WordPress gaming themes out there to form a solid base for the latest hot gaming site.

What you want out of a WordPress gaming theme depends on what you want your site to focus on. Do you want it to be an accompaniment to a YouTube channel, showcasing your latest video Lets Plays, reviews, and walkthroughs? A simple review and ranking site? A place for more in depth criticism? A space for your crew/guild? A forum for your favourite niche indie? Whichever direction you take, you’ll need a WordPress gaming theme with the features you want - and there’s plenty out there.

WordPress gaming themes come in many shapes and sizes, just like the sites described above. Media integration and gallery features are common in themes emphasising visual content; custom email sign-up forms in more dedicated news sites; and comment sections are a must for those wanting to encourage (healthy!) discussion.

You’ll find all the above in more in our top WordPress gaming themes of {{ site.time | date: '%Y' }}...
