Magazine themes are a popular way to make WordPress sites that look less like blogs and more like news sites.

WordPress Magazine themes are perfect for any type of news or content oriented website that has a lot of information to display in a limited amount of space. For instance, an extreme example could be the BBC news website. Obviously they have a custom solution since they are so big - but if they were to run on WordPress then they could easily reproduce their homepage with a WordPress magazine style theme.

Magazine themes often work well for media heavy sites - such as video game news and reviews sites, or music and entertainment sites. They are also frequently used for schools, colleges, and churchs. There's a lot of potential uses for a WordPress magazine theme.
