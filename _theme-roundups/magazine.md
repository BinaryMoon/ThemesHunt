WordPress Magazine themes are a popular way to make sites that look less like blogs and more like news sites.

WordPress Magazine themes are perfect for any type of news or content oriented website that has a lot of information to display in a limited amount of space. News can be sorted by category for easy navigation, with powerful internal search tools to help users find the stories they’re after quickly.

WordPress Magazine themes often work well for media heavy sites - such as video game news and reviews sites, or music and entertainment sites. They are also frequently used for schools, colleges, and churches. There’re a lot of potential uses for a WordPress magazine theme.
